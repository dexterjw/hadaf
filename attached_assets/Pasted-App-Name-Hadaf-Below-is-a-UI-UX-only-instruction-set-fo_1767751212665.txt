App Name: Hadaf

Below is a **UI/UX-only instruction set** for an AI design agent.  
All logic is assumed to exist; your job is **interface, interaction, and behavioral impact**.

---

# **AI UI/UX DESIGN INSTRUCTIONS**

**Project:** Project Hadaf – Hifdh Calculator  
**Scope:** UI, UX, interaction design, visual feedback, behavioral framing  
**Explicit Exclusions:** No backend logic, no math formulas, no data modeling

---

## **1. UX North Star**

Design an interface that **removes negotiation** and **forces cognitive ownership** by making time consequences visible, immediate, and emotionally weighted.

If a student misses a day, they should _feel_ it in the UI.

---

## **2. Universal UI Principles (Apply Everywhere)**

### **A. Cause → Effect Must Be Immediate**

- Every user action must produce **visible change within 300ms**
    
- No silent recalculation
    
- No hidden state
    

### **B. Dates Are the Primary Currency**

- Dates must be:
    
    - Large
        
    - Central
        
    - Animated when they change
        
- Numbers like “lines/day” are secondary
    

### **C. Asymmetry of Feedback**

- Negative feedback (missed target):
    
    - Larger motion
        
    - Slower easing
        
    - Stronger contrast
        
- Positive feedback:
    
    - Subtle
        
    - Encouraging, not euphoric
        

---

## **3. Variation 1 — Timeline-Centric / Goal Ownership UI**

### **Primary UX Goal**

Make the finish date feel like a _chosen commitment_, not a suggestion.

---

### **Layout Hierarchy**

1. **Hero Finish Date (Top, Fixed)**
    
    - Largest text on screen
        
    - Label: “Projected Khatam”
        
    - Color shifts based on feasibility
        
    - Always visible on scroll
        
2. **Timeline Visualization (Middle)**
    
    - Horizontal, left → right
        
    - Anchors:
        
        - Start
            
        - Today
            
        - Finish
            
    - Timeline stretches/contracts on interaction
        
3. **Control Inputs (Bottom)**
    
    - Sliders, toggles, date picker
        
    - Never compete visually with the finish date
        

---

### **Mode Switching UX**

- Use a **segmented control**
    
- Only one mode visible at a time
    
- Transition animation must:
    
    - Fade numbers
        
    - Keep date visible (reinforces ownership)
        

---

### **Slip UX (Critical)**

When a missed day is logged:

- Timeline pulls right with resistance
    
- Finish date:
    
    - Physically moves
        
    - Momentarily enlarges
        
- Micro-copy:
    
    > “Recovery required. Finish date moved.”
    

This interaction must feel **heavier** than any positive interaction.

---

### **Reality Toggles UX**

- Collapsible “Reality Check” panel
    
- Each toggle:
    
    - Instantly stretches the timeline
        
    - Shows delta (e.g. “+2 months”)
        
- Avoid checklists that feel optional or ignorable
    

---

### **Anti-Patterns to Avoid**

- Static charts
    
- Hidden consequences
    
- Tooltips as primary explanation
    
- Allowing unrealistic plans without visual warning
    

---

## **4. Variation 2 — Daily Accountability / Habit UI**

### **Primary UX Goal**

Make _today_ feel like the lever that moves the entire future.

---

### **Layout Hierarchy**

1. **Daily Action Card (Top)**
    
    - One-tap state selection:
        
        - Hit
            
        - Partial
            
        - Missed
            
    - Must be thumb-reachable on mobile
        
2. **Today’s Work Block**
    
    - Today’s sabaq
        
    - Today’s manzil (time-based)
        
    - Visual progress indicator supports partials
        
3. **Finish Date Tracker (Persistent)**
    
    - Smaller than Variation 1
        
    - Still animated on change
        
    - Acts as a scoreboard
        

---

### **Feedback UX Rules**

- **Hit Target**
    
    - Finish date slides slightly left
        
    - Soft color pulse
        
    - Short affirmation text
        
- **Missed Target**
    
    - Finish date jumps right
        
    - Stronger motion + easing
        
    - Message explains _why_, not _that_
        

---

### **Weekly View UX**

- Calendar-style strip
    
- Rest days visually distinct
    
- Dragging rest days:
    
    - Immediately updates finish date
        
    - Shows cumulative impact
        

---

### **Manzil UX**

- Always visible
    
- Expressed as **time**, not abstract units
    
- Cannot be hidden or disabled
    

---

## **5. Visual Language Guidelines**

- Use motion to explain consequences
    
- Prefer spatial changes over numeric deltas
    
- Avoid “productivity app” aesthetics
    
- Tone: serious, calm, inevitable
    

---

## **6. Accessibility & Clarity**

- Color never the sole indicator
    
- Motion must be paired with text
    
- All date changes must be readable post-animation
    

---

## **7. Success Metrics (UX-Only)**

The UI succeeds if:

- A missed day feels costly without shame
    
- Students stop asking for reductions
    
- The finish date becomes the reference point in conversation
    
- The interface feels like a mirror, not a judge
    

---

## **8. Deliverables Expected From the AI Agent**

- High-fidelity screen designs for both variations
    
- Motion/interaction descriptions for:
    
    - Slips
        
    - Progress
        
    - Reality toggles
        
- Clear hierarchy rationale for each screen
    
- UX justification tied to behavior change (not aesthetics)

- **Microcopy system**
    
- **Motion specs (timing, easing, hierarchy)**
    
- **Mobile-first vs desktop tradeoffs**
